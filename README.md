# Android Unit Testing and Test Driven Development

This project is to explore the testing processes of Android applications by integrating the knowledges and tools from the lectures and the assignments. The system under testing is a simple stackOverFlow Browser android application, which is constructed using MVC pattern. Since there are many external and internal dependencies while developing android application, the project focused on TestDouble and Mocking to simulate the external dependencies, and the coverage testing and mutation testing were also applied in this project to make sure there are sufficient test units to cover all functions and there is not coverage gap in the application. At the end, test driven development will be briefly introduced as the future learning path.
